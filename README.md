# AegisEDR – Endpoint Detection & Response System

AegisEDR is a host-based monitoring project designed to simulate how endpoint telemetry can be collected and analyzed for security monitoring.

The system observes endpoint-level activity such as process execution, file system changes in sensitive locations, and active network connections to understand how behavioral patterns on a host can indicate suspicious activity.

By applying rule-based detections on collected telemetry, the system generates alerts to highlight potential anomalies that may require further investigation.

This project was implemented in a controlled lab setup for educational purposes to explore endpoint monitoring and response mechanisms commonly used in modern security operations environments.
